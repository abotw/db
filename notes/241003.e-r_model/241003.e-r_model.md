## E-R diagram

- **E-R diagram**: high-level design model representing a database as a **collection of entities and relationships** among entities
- **Entity**: ~an object (thing to keep track to run the business)
- **Entity set**: ~a class (~table, a collection of things of the same kind)
- **Instance** ~actual occurrence of the entity (~row in a table)
- **Attribute** ~ a field (property of the entities in that set)

## Attributes

- **Single-valued attribute** – allows a single value
- **Multi-valued attribute** – allows multiple values at the same time
- **Derived attribute** –can be calculated from one or more attributes
- **Composite attribute**
	- consists of multiple values
	- can have as many levels as needed

## Relationships

- Connections among two or more entity sets
- **Binary relationships** – connections between two entity sets
- **Multi-way relationships (u-ary)** – connections involving more than two entity sets

## Binary Relationships

- If A and B are sets, a relationship R is a subset of A X B
- Cardinality (or Multiplicity)
	- A binary relationship can connect any member of one of its entity sets to any number of members of the other entity set

## Total Participation

- **Total participation** – all entities in an entity set **must** participate in the relationship
