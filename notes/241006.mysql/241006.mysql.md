==> Caveats

We've installed your MySQL database without a root password. To secure it run:

mysql_secure_installation

MySQL is configured to only allow connections from localhost by default

To connect run:

mysql -uroot

mysql@5.7 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,

because this is an alternate version of another formula.

If you need to have mysql@5.7 first in your PATH, run:

echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql@5.7/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find mysql@5.7 you may need to set:

export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql@5.7/lib"

export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql@5.7/include"

To restart mysql@5.7 after an upgrade:

brew services restart mysql@5.7

Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:

/opt/homebrew/opt/mysql@5.7/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir=/opt/homebrew/var/mysql

==> Summary

🍺  /opt/homebrew/Cellar/mysql@5.7/5.7.39: 320 files, 232.3MB

==> Running `brew cleanup mysql@5.7`...

Disable this behaviour by setting HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_CLEANUP.

Hide these hints with HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_HINTS (see `man brew`).
```

```bash
> brew services restart mysql@5.7
```

```bash
> use mysql
> update user set authentication_string = password('root') where User='root';
```

```bash
shell> mysql -u root -p

mysql> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'NEWPWD';
```
