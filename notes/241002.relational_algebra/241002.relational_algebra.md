# Note 2: Relational Algebra

## Relational Algebra

- A language for querying relational data based on fundamental relational **operations**.
- Each operation takes one or more relations (i.e., tables) as its input and output a new relation.
- Compose operations to make complex queries.

- Selection σp(R)
- Projection ΠA1,...,Ak (R)
- Product R × S
- Union R ∪ S
- Difference R − S
- Renaming ρS(A1,...,Ak)(R), ρS(R)

## Selection

- The **selection** operation selects tuples that satisfy a given **predicate**.

$$
\sigma_{p}(R)
$$

- $$R$$ is the input relation and $$p$$ is the selection predicate (or condition).

## Projection

## Cartesian Product

## Join

## Union

## Difference

## Renaming
