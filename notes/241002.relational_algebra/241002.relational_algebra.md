# Note 2: Relational Algebra

## Relational Algebra

- A language for querying relational data based on fundamental relational **operations**.
- Each operation takes one or more relations (i.e., tables) as its input and output a new relation.
- Compose operations to make complex queries.

- Selection σp(R)
- Projection ΠA1,...,Ak (R)
- Product R × S
- Union R ∪ S
- Difference R − S
- Renaming ρS(A1,...,Ak)(R), ρS(R)

## Selection

- The **selection** operation selects tuples that satisfy a given **predicate**.

$$
\sigma_{p}(R)
$$

- $$R$$ is the input relation and $$p$$ is the selection predicate (or condition).
- e.g.
	- The following operation $$\sigma_{dept\_name=
	"Physics"}(instructor)$$ get all the instructors in the Physics department.
- Boolean connectives `=`, `≠`, `<`, `⩽`, `>` and `⩾` are allowed in predicates.
- Combine predicates with **logical connectives** `∧` (and), `∨` (or), `¬` (not).
- e.g.
	- $$\sigma_{dept\_name}="Physics"$$
